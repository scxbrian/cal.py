                <h3>About My Project</h3>
                <p>This page is my first attempt at building a website from scratch. My goal was to use only HTML5 and focus on using the right tags for the right job, rather than just using `div` everywhere. It's a bit of a meta project, reallyâ€”a web page about making a web page!</p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways from the Experience</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Semantic is not just for SEO!</h4>
                        <p>I learned that using tags like `header`, `nav`, and `main` makes the code so much more readable for me and other developers. It's like writing with proper grammar.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Accessibility is easier than I thought.</h4>
                        <p>By simply using `alt` attributes on my images and a clear heading structure (`h2`, `h3`), I'm already making a huge difference for screen reader users. It's a little extra work, but it's totally worth it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Structure is everything.</h4>
                        <p>Before, I would just throw things on a page. Now, I see how a well-structured document, with `article` and `section` tags, creates a logical flow for the reader and a clear path for search engines.</p>
